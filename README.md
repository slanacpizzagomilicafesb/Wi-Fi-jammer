# Wi-Fi-jammer
This project was made as a part of Sigurnost Bežičnih Mreža course. The goal of this project was to make a small electrical circuit which jammed Wi-Fi signals on certain channels. To change channels, we used a button on the Arduino circuit board. The circuit sent junk data to overflow the channel, thus jamming the channel and disconnecting all connected devices.
